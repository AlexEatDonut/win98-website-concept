# win98-website-concept

Old project attempting to make my website into win98.

This was a personal website project made that would have been alexeatdonut.net. I haven't gotten around to actually complete it in over 2 years.

Includes every single Windows 98 icons, for some reason. I had a weird workflow.

<img src="./readme-assets/img/preview1.png" alt="No windows were opened." height="480px"/>
<img src="./readme-assets/img/preview2.png" alt="2 windows were opened." height="480px"/>

Requires you to set it up in Xampp and to fill in content yourself. I'm also not including my own data (obviously).
